    "# Diffusion tensor model\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of the previously mentioned diffusion model is that it does not perform well in anisotropic areas of the brain since it does not take gradient direction into account and thus cannot estimate the direction of diffusion. The diffusion tensor model is a direct extension of the previous model to 3D. The implicit assumption of the DT model is that the dispersion pattern is a trivariate Gaussian. Therefore DT is proportional to the covariance matrix of the distribution. The positive-definitivness of DT ensures that the diffusivity will always be positive (negative diffusivity is meaningless).\n",
