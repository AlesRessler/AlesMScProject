    "# Diffusion MRI\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion MRI is capable of revealing the underlying architecture of brain tissue by sensing the dispersion of water molecules due to the Brownian motion. Water diffusivity can be defined as the variance of displacement of water molecule from its original position per unit time. The difusion patterns vary greatly with the region of the brain. The areas without bariers (e.g. in ventricles) exhibit isotropic diffusion i.e. the diffusion magnitude is the same in all directions. On the other hand diffusion in more restricted areas (e.g. in axons) is anisotropic i.e. depends on direction. This is the case since the water enclosed within an axon is free to move along the fibre but the movement perpendicular to the axon is much more limited. Anisotropic patterns can then be used to determine dominant fibre direction in a voxel.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before the diffusion anisotropy depends on the region of the brain. Since white matter acts as an interconnection between brain regions it contains many axon bundles going in the same direction thus the voxels in these areas exhibit large anisotropy since the water is enclosed within axon bundles and therefore is concentrated in one main direction. However grey matter primarily consists of neuronal cell bodies. Even though the water is also enclosed within a cell the shape if these cell bodies is not elongated like axons and hence does not favor diffusion in any particular direction thus the diffusion is isotropic. Finally the diffusion in ventricles is unrestricted because they are filled with only cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore the diffusion is isotropic as in grey matter but the magnitude of the diffusivity will be larger than in gray matter since it is not obstructed by cell bodies.\n",

    "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) scanners have a multitude of possible device settings to influence the scanner's sensitivity to water dispersion. All these settings can be summarized in a quantity called diffusion weighting factor also known as b-value. B-value is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b=(\\gamma \\delta \\left \\| G \\right \\|)^{2}(\\Delta -\\frac{\\delta}{3})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, $\\delta$ is the length of the gradient pulse, $\\Delta$ time between the beginnings of the gradient pulses and $G$ is the magnetic gradient vector. See figure below for a diagram of the pulse sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "Echo is the time when singnal is recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images taken with $b>0$ are said to be diffusion weighted and have a corresponding gradient orientation $\\hat{q}$ which determines the direction of diffusion sensitivity. Ultimately, taking measurements with fixed $b$ and varying $\\hat{q}$ can highlight directional structure of the tissue. Finally the images taken with $b=0$ are taken without the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is possible to relate measurements with non-zero b-value $S(b)$, measurements with zero b-value $S(0)$ and diffusivity $d$ via a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S(b)=S(0)e^{-bd}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms can be rearanged to express $d$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d=\\frac{1}{b}(logS(0)-logS(b))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the diffusivity can be estimated by taking measurements $S(b)$ and $S(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice more than 2 measurements are taken in order to reduce noisiness of the diffusivity map. Parameters of the model are then estimated by performing a linear fit of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "First step is to linearize the model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$logS(b)=logS(0)-bd$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then replace the true signal by a noisy measurement $A(b)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$logA(b)=logS(0)-bd$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the parameters that need to be estimated are $logS(0)$ and $d$. This can be done by taking $n$ measurements with $b>0$ and establishing a system of linear equations $A=Gx$ where $A$ is the column vector of $n$ $A(b)$ measurements, $G$ is the design matrix and $x$ is the column vector of unknown parameters:\n",

    "This is an ordinary least squares problem which can be solved with Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse:\n",

    "$$x = (G^{T}G)^{-1}G^{T}A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute parameter map over the whole 3D volume this linear model needs to be fit to each voxel separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately this model has significant limitations. It is only able to achieve satisfactory accuracy in regions with isotropic diffusion. However in areas with large anisotropy the model does not perform very well since the diffusivity changes with gradient direction and the model does not take gradient orientation into account. This is further confirmed by the figure below which shows predicted and true values of diffusion in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM). It can be seen that the prediction error increases with the anisotropy of the region.\n",
