    "Even though the diffusion tensor model was among the first widely adopted models, it has major limitations, i.e. it is unable to resolve complex fibre configurations such as fibre crossings or (in a tractography context) track fibres through regions of crossing fibres. The diffusion tensor only shows the overall diffusion in a voxel. The issue of crossing fibres was first disregarded since it was believed that only a few problematic regions (like centrum semiovale and pons) were affected. However, further studies have shown that fibre crossings are of common occurrence in the human brain. According to the estimates, 70-90% of white matter contains fibre crossings of at least two fibre populations$^{[1,2,3,4]}$. Therefore spherical deconvolution (SD) was adopted to model multiple fibre orientations in a voxel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption of SD is that the diffusion properties of white matter fibres are the same across all brain regions (this behaviour is modelled by the \"fibre response function\" see below), and thus the changes in detected signal are only caused by partial volume effects."

    "Mixture models estimate the orientation of fibres and their volume fractions by modelling the signal that would be captured for a single population of fibres. The actual signal coming from a voxel is thus assumed to be composed of signals that would have been measured for each population (compartment) in isolation. Water exachge between compartments is not assumed to be negligible. The diffusion due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be modelled by an isotropic compartment."

    "fODF can be interpreted as a probability density function of fibres going in a particular direction. Some researchers hold the view that diffusion orientation density function (dODF) should be the function of interest since it can be estimated via the ensemble average spin propagator which is a model-free approach and thus is also the most unbiased. However dODF is not equivalent to dODF (even though dODF is strongly infuenced by fODF) and only provides indirect information regarding the actual fibre orientations. Even when single coherent fibre population is present, dODF will still suggest a wide range of orientations centered around the actual orientation. On the other hand methods that estimate fODF directly often yield sharper and more accurate functions $^{[4,5]}$ see figure below.\n",

And since this works focus is on mapping of brain connectivity and given that tractography algorithms require accurate estimates of fODFs it is sensible to estimate fODF directly from the MRI data.\n",

    "As mentioned above the core concept behind spherical deconvolution is that the voxel signal can be expressed as a weighted sum of one or more fibre populations. These populations are assumed to be identical in terms of their signal response i.e. the signal is attenuated along the fibres and preserved across the fibres. Thus the resulting voxel signal depends only the orientation of the fibres and the fraction of volume they occupy in the voxel. Equivalently the signal can also be expressed as a convolution over the sphere of an fODF with an FRF. See figure below:\n",
